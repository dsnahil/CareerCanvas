## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22 or higher)
- Yarn package manager (Use 'npm install yarn -g' to install yarn)
- LM Studio (for local language model support)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/javienc/careercanvas
   cd careercanvas
   ```

### Setup for development

1. Install dependencies and setup everything:
   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```

## ü§ñ Setting Up LM Studio

Career Canvas requires a running LM Studio model for optimal performance. Follow these steps to set it up:

### Installing LM Studio

1. Download LM Studio from the [official website](https://lmstudio.ai/):
   - For Windows/macOS: Download the appropriate installer
   - For Snapdragon computers: Download the ARM-compatible version (LM Studio 0.3.10 or newer supports Snapdragon X Elite)

2. Install LM Studio following the on-screen instructions.

### Configuring LM Studio for Career Canvas

1. Launch LM Studio.

2. Download a compatible model:
   - For Snapdragon computers, we recommend smaller models like Mistral 7B or Llama 3 8B for optimal performance
   - Models with 8-16GB RAM requirements work best on Snapdragon systems

3. Load your chosen model in LM Studio.

4. Enable the local API server:
   - Go to Settings > API Server
   - Toggle "Enable local API server"
   - Note the API URL (typically http://localhost:1234)

5. Connecting the local llm by click the setting icon on the bottom left and select LM Studio as the LLM provider

6. Keep LM Studio running while using Career Canvas.

### Snapdragon-Specific Optimizations
On a Snapdragon computer:

1. Ensure you're using LM Studio 0.3.10 or newer which has specific ARM/Snapdragon optimizations.

2. In LM Studio settings:
   - Reduce the number of CPU threads to 6-8 for better stability
   - Set GPU layers to "Auto" or a lower value (4-8) to balance performance and resource usage
   - Enable "Low VRAM mode" if available

3. Monitor system performance and adjust settings as needed.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Development Mode (Run all from the root folder)

1. Start the server: (To boot the server locally)
   ```bash
   yarn dev:server
   ```

2. Start the frontend: (To boot the frontend locally)
   ```bash
   yarn dev:frontend
   ```

3. Start the document collector: (To then run the document collector)
   ```bash
   yarn dev:collector
   ```

### Verifying LM Studio Connection

1. After starting the server, check the console logs for successful connection to LM Studio.

2. If you encounter connection issues:
   - Ensure LM Studio is running and the API server is enabled
   - Check that your model is properly loaded in LM Studio
   - For Snapdragon systems, try restarting LM Studio with fewer CPU threads

## üìö Additional Notes

- The application is designed to run primarily on the edge, with hybrid edge/cloud capabilities.
- For optimal performance, ensure your vector database is properly configured.
- Check the documentation for more advanced configuration options.
- On Snapdragon systems, monitor CPU and memory usage to ensure stable performance.
